## Introduction: What Is DermaRx Skin Tag Remover?

[DermaRx Tag Free Serum](https://www.facebook.com/dermarxtagfreeserum) is a topical treatment designed to effectively remove skin tags without the need for surgery or other invasive procedures. Skin tags are small, benign growths that often form in areas where the skin folds, such as the neck, armpits, eyelids, and groin. While they aren’t dangerous, many people find them aesthetically displeasing, which is where DermaRx comes in.

## How Does DermaRx Skin Tag Remover Work?

The science behind DermaRx Skin Tag Remover is simple yet effective. The product contains natural ingredients that penetrate the skin tag, drying it out from the inside. Over time, the skin tag shrinks, eventually falling off without causing any pain or discomfort.

Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of how to work and apply:

Application: Apply the product directly onto the skin tag using the provided applicator.
Absorption: The formula gets absorbed into the skin tag and starts breaking down the tissue.
Drying Out: As the active ingredients work, the skin tag starts to dry out and shrink.
Removal: Within days or weeks (depending on the size), the skin tag will fall off naturally.
Healing: The area heals without leaving a scar, revealing smooth, healthy skin.

Slight burning or tingling sensation after application
